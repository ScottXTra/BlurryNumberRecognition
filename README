Creating you own training data (THIS STEP IS NOT REQUIRED, AS IT COMES WITH DATA) (This may take 5 mins depending on IO speed and CPU) > python3 generate_images.py
Train the network > python3 train_network.py
Predict using unseen data > python3 predict.py data/test/<number 1 - 9> (Example python3 predict.py data/test/3)

This could be adpated to take hand drawn numbers converted to monochrome
